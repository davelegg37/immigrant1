A Guide For the Prospective Immigrant 


The following is a practical guide for you, the prospective Immigrant, as you play the Immigration Game.  The guide is in three sections.  The first section describes the entire Immigration Process and how to win or lose the game, i.e. be a successful or unsuccessful Immigrant.  The second section provides practical advice on how to make decisions as an Immigrant or prospective Immigrant in each phase of the Immigration Process.  The third section describes various strategies for your consideration given your individual starting condition.  The game begins with a prospective Immigrant in the Homeland.  It ends in one of two ways  1) death resulting from  risks taken and/or lack of luck,  2) "End of Game"  appearing on the screen.   



Section One - Immigration: How To Win



There are two ways to have success (gain points) in the  Immigration Process and therefore the game.  Strange as it may seem the first is to not  immigrate at all.  Remember, most of us would rather forego all the risk, turmoil and problems of uprooting our lives,  moving to another land with different customs, cultures, languages etc. and reestablishing ourselves.  One of the main forces operating on Immigrants are the conditions in the homeland; famine, war,  lack of opportunity and persecution, both religious and political.  These forces all operate to push  Immigrants from their homeland to havens in other countries.  Even when Immigrants leave their homeland, their longing for the homeland often draws them back if they can find a way.  


This being the case, the first way to win the Immigrant Game is to accumulate years in the homeland, one point for one year.  This can be done by either not leaving the homeland or by returning to the homeland from the new country.   Remaining in the homeland or returning to that land leaves the Immigrant exposed to the depredations of the homeland and possible death. 



Remember death ends the game.  The odds of avoiding death in the homeland vary with who you are and what homeland  you find yourself in.  Poor people in countries facing declining  economic conditions have a greater risk of death than those in countries with more stable economies.  Politically active Immigrants in politically unstable homelands face a greater chance of death than those in countries with more stable, less repressive  governments.  The same is true when returning to the homeland. 






Just as an Immigrant can be forced out of his homeland he can also be attracted to the new country by the prospects of a better life.  The second way then to win in the Immigrant Game is success in the new land.  Success is measured by the amount of money made in the new land.

To summarize,  the Immigrant Game ends when you die  so  your first goal is to try to survive as long as you can.   This task is complicated by the fact that you do not know how long the game will last.  It may help to think of the end of the game as natural death and death in the game as premature death.  Your object is to avoid premature death and build up a high score.  If you manage to survive the game your score will be determined by two factors, the number of years that you have accumulated in the homeland and the amount of money you have accumulated in the new country.   Your score increases by surviving in the homeland (one year of survival gives you one point) or by making money in the newland ( $1000 made in the new land equates to one point.)







Section Two - The Immigrant Game: How to Play


The Immigrant Game is based on the universal Immigration Process which has persisted throughout history.  Although this process was quite different in its specifics for different Immigrant groups, it  had certain universal constants that were the same for all groups.  The Irish experience of the mid 1800's,  although different from the Mexican and Vietnamese experiences  of the 1970's and 80's,  had certain things in common with both.  The Immigrant Game simulates these universal characteristics.  The differences are simulated by the different roles and types of countries assigned the player at the beginning of the game.  For instance, although every player will face the decision of whether or not to immigrate, a  player that is poor in a poor country will probably make different decisions  then a rich player in a rich country. 


 The Immigrant Game begins by assigning the player both a role and a country.  These two factors will govern the rest of the game for the player.  Each player should consider these two factors carefully when making decisions for the rest of that particular game since his resources and his decisions should be  consistent with these two factors. 


During the Immigrant Game, the player faces all the decisions a typical Immigrant must make. These decisions are not made all at once but over time.  Each decision represents a year in the Immigrant's life.  The game lasts for an unspecified number of years that varies with each game.  The length of each game certainly effects the outcome but, unfortunately for the player,  he has no way of knowing how long the game will last except that it will not go on forever and the longer it lasts the greater the probability of its ending. 


Each decision must be based on the preceding  one.   For instance, you cannot decide to take a plane to the new country until you have first decided to immigrate.   You can not farm in the new

country until you are in the new country.  The game progresses as the player faces and then makes the decisions faced by his historical counterpart. 





The rest of this section will concern itself with an explanation of the progression of these decisions and the factors which should be taken into consideration in making each individual decision. 






To Go or Not to Go


The first decision which faces each Immigrant is whether or not to immigrate.  The primary  consideration of whether or not to immigrate is survival. The odds of survival for a politically active person in a highly unstable  state are not very high and immigration is very much in his interest.  A rich man in an economically stable country would have less interest in immigration. 


Other factors, although secondary are none the less important.   Rich people have more money available to spend in the actual act of immigration, the trip to the new country, but  that supply of money dwindles the longer they remain in the old country.  There is also the simple desire for adventure.  If you choose not to immigrate you may gain another year in the homeland and  score points toward a win but you do not move on to the next decision and experience the excitement of the next round of activity.



.     The Process of Getting There


Once the player has decided to immigrate he is faced with a whole set of decisions commonly  to  the Immigration Process.   During this movement from the home country to the new country the Immigrant has two resources to expend, money and time.   With each expenditure there is a cost.   With money the cost is obvious but the cost of time is more subtle. Everyone, rich and poor, has time.   All travel costs both time and money.  The more money you spend on travel the less time you have to spend.   Even the poorest individual can get to where he wants to go if he is willing to walk, a very slow and risky method of  travel.  The more time a player takes to get to the new country, the less time he has to make money there.  With the costs of travel in mind and also the fact that The Immigrant Game is a generic representation all immigration movements,  let us consider the two phases of this movement of people we think of as Immigration.


  


The first phase of the Immigration Process is to get to a port of departure, either a major city or a port of some type.  In The Immigrant Game there are two ways of traveling to this port of departure,  by train or by foot.  To travel by foot does not cost money,  but  does cost one year of time  and has a high risk of death. 



In the New Country


After arriving in the new country  the  Immigrant's goal changes.  He can either plan on staying in the new country trying to make  money  to build his score or use it as a temporary safe haven and move back to the old country.  In any case the Immigrant experience in the new land will  involve one of two options;  remaining in city where you first arrive, working in a low paying job or moving out West, acquiring land and becoming a farmer.  Remaining in the city requires little cost in terms of money and time but you cannot make much money.  Moving out West and acquiring a farm is more costly in terms of time and money but you have the potential to make much more money than in the city.  No matter where you are in the new country you have a chance of striking it rich but that chance is very  slim in the city and much greater in the West. 


 


Living and working in the city represents the low pay of a sweat shop type job combined with high risks involved in living in an urban slum.  Consequently,  you cannot earn much money and the risk of death is present, although not usually  as high as the risk in the home country.  Moving West represents escaping the city and acquiring the resources to make money.  The Immigrant  has  a much greater chance of making money moving West but it does cost both money and time  which he may or may not have.  There are two methods of travel to the West;  walking or taking a train.   Once there you must acquire land to farm.  If you do not have enough money to buy land you can either rent or share crop the land.  In either of these cases you do not own the land.  If you own the land it will always be worth what you paid for it or more at the end of game.   If you sell the land before the end of the game, it will be worth only half what you paid for it.


      


.    Stay or Return Home


The last decision you must make is whether or not to stay in the new world.   You can choose to return to the home country from anywhere in the new country.   If you decide to return to the home the cost is $1000 but the trip is risk free and takes no time. 






Section Three -  Strategies for Playing the Immigrant Game 


Decision Reference Guide


Decision #1   To Immigrate or Remain in the Home Country


This is your first major decision.  


.  If you decide to remain in the home country for the year you risk death or economic        catastrophe.  


.       If you die, the game ends and you lose.  


.    Economic catastrophe leaves you with fewer resources  to immigrate with later in the game. 


.          If you run out of money while in the home country,  you have one year to leave or die.


.       If you stay in the home country and survive you will accumulate a year in the home country  


        and these years increase your score.


Decision #2  Transport to the Home Country Point of Departure.






There are two choices of transport to the point of departure, both of which involve costs. 


.          Walk which does not cost money but does cost time, one year.  It also involves the risk of    death  or economic catastrophe. 


.     Take the train which does not take time but  money,  $300. 






Decision #3  Transport to the New Country






You have three choices of transport to the new country. 


.     The fastest and least risky is to fly for $1000  (no cost in time and no risk of death or     economic catastrophe). 


.   A ship  is slower, it takes 1 year with no risk of death or economic catastrophe and costs only       $ 300.  


.     If you are poor you can stow away.  The cost is only $100 but the risk of death or economic 





      catastrophe is high. 






Decision #4   What to do in the New Country






Once you have arrived in the new country you can begin to play for money. There are three ways of making money in the new country. Two of which you can choose and one of which is chosen for you by luck. 






.  Remain in the city where you landed  working as unskilled labor in a sweat shop.         Remaining  in the city will not cost  money or time but the job pays only $100 a year and        life in the city is risky.  You can be killed  or  robbed.  The risk of death or financial loss in the city is not as high as it  was in the home country but it is still there. 






.  Go West and farm.  This involves  time and expense.  As with the trip to the port of departure in the home country, you can either walk or take the train.  Just as in the home country taking the train is fast and risk free but costs money, $200 one way.  If you do not have    $200 you can walk but, just as in the home county, it takes time and has risks of death and economic catastrophe. 


 Once you have reached the farmland you can farm. The money you make farming depends on how much land you cultivate.  The more land you cultivate the more money you will make. The base income for a unit of cultivated land is $100  however the price of farm produce varies and your income can vary by a factor of 1, 2 or 4.  For instance in a good year you can make $400 on one unit of cultivated land but in bad years one unit of  cultivated land will produce sweat shop wages of $100. 


Getting to the western land is only part of becoming a farmer.  You must also acquire the land to farm.  Each unit of land cost $500.   It can be purchased out right, in this case the land belongs to you and you keep the full income from its cultivation.   At the end of the game the original  dollar value of your land will be added to your score, and in some cases more will be         added because the value of the  land will have appreciated.  If you sell your land before the game ends it is only worth half the original price, $250.






      If you don't wish  or can't afford to buy land, you can rent the land or be a sharecropper.  The  cost of renting  is $100 a year while the cost of sharecropping  is 50 % of everything you make.  






 There is one other way to make money in the new country,  strike it rich.  Each year you remain in the new country there is the chance that you might strike it rich.  There is a slim  chance you can strike it rich in the city but a greater chance  if you live in the country.


Decision #5   To Stay in the New Country or Return to the Home Country






You do not have to stay in the new country.  The decision to return "home" can be made at any time.  If you decide to return, all the decisions you made in coming to the new country must be made again, but this time in reverse.


Your Resources in the Game  






In this game  everyone has the same amount of time, the length of the game.  The problem of time is the same for everyone, no one knows when it will run out and the game ends.   Time varies with each game. 


Not everyone begins the game with the same amount of money.  The rich begin with $1000 while the poor only have $500. There are two types of money in this game, the money you begin the game with and the money you make in the new country. The money you begin with can be used for anything in the game such as buying passage, land, withstanding economic catastrophes etc., but it will not directly effect you final score.  Money you make in the new country can do all this and more.  The amount you have at the end of the game that was acquired in the new country will count towards your final score. 


Score


If you survive the game, do not die, your score will be determined by the two factors;  the number of years you accumulated in the home land and the amount of money you made in the new world.  For purposes of your score,  one year in the home country  or $1000 made in the new country converts to one point.











 



The second phase, which  involves crossing both political borders and natural barriers such as oceans,  is more expensive in terms of both time  and money.  The Immigrant Game gives the player three travel options in the second  phase of the the actual immigration.  The quickest and safest option is by plane.  It is also the most expensive.  You can also go by boat which is less expensive  but slower then by plane.   The least expensive travel method is stowing away and it is both illegal and dangerous.

		<div>Welcome to the Immigrant Game. In the real world most of us learn by doing. We learn to drive cars, do our jobs, how to bake cookies all by doing, and when we make mistakes we quickly learn from those mistakes and readjust. Humans are very good at learning by doing which also  involves watching then copying and learning from our mistakes.
Real World /Game World engages this learning by the “doing” strategy rather  than the memorization strategies or the information in/ information out, of more traditional educational approaches.
In the Immigrant Game you can learn the immigrant experience by being an immigrant. Unlike like real immigrants even though you die in the game you can play again and learn by your mistake. To enhance this learning experience you might want to jot down what you learned after each game. Your increasing score should reflect your increasing understanding of the immigration process. Be sure and compare your experience with the actual immigrants, you may be able to learn something from their experience.
